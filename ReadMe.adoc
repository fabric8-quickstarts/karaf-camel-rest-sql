= Karaf Camel REST / SQL QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to use SQL via JDBC along with Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API.

This example relies on the https://maven.fabric8.io['Fabric8 Maven plugin'] for its build configuration.

IMPORTANT: This quickstart can run in 1 mode: on Kubernetes / OpenShift Cluster

== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

To deploy this quickstart to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/karaf-camel-rest-sql`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/karaf-camel-rest-sql
----

. It is assumed that a MySQL service is already running on the platform. You can deploy it using the provided deployment by executing in single-node OpenShift cluster:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f mysql-deployment.yml
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `karaf-camel-rest-sql` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `karaf-camel-rest-sql` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/pods/karaf-camel-rest-sql-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the messages sent by Camel.

== Accessing the REST service

When the example is running, a REST service is available to list the books that can be ordered, and as well the order statuses.

If you run the example on a single-node OpenShift cluster, then the REST service is exposed at 'http://karaf-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/`.

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you. Add the `-Dfabric8.deploy.createExternalUrls=true` option to your Maven commands if you want it to deploy a Route configuration for the service.

The actual endpoint is using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/books` and the REST service provides two services:

- `books`: to list all the available books that can be ordered,
- `books/order/{id}`: to output order status for the given order `id`.

The example automatically creates new orders with a running order `id` starting from 1.

You can then access these services from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://karaf-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/books>
- <http://karaf-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1>

== Swagger API

The example provides API documentation of the service using Swagger using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/api-doc`. You can access the API documentation from your Web browser at <http://karaf-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/api-doc>.
